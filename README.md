# RISC-V-single-cycle-processor
This is RISC-V single cycle processor which I have completed as course project. In this project I have uploaded all verilog codes and the instructions(written to verify this processor) for fabonacci series.
The instruction, to calculate fabonacci, is written in instruction memory.This fabonacci series checks the performance of my proccesor.
Here I have made this processor to work for r-type,s-type,i-type,b-type,and j-type instruction.
